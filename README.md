=========

This repository currently includes the raw data measurements used in producing the paper:

"On the efficacy of WiFi indoor positioning in a practical setting" presented in the eighteenth IEEE symposium on Computers and Communications. 

As the paper has not been presented yet (this will happen in IEEE-ISCC in July 2013) only raw measurements are included here for now; we will populate this with more content after the presentation date.

NOTE: These measurements were produced by tools developed by Gregory Albiston (<gregory.albiston2012@my.ntu.ac.uk>) who was also the lead surveyor for the measurements.
